# SDET Interview Prep

## Infosys Overview

- Typically with Infosys we see relatively short interviews 30 - 45 mins (and usually only 1 round). 
- The interviews tend to focus on technical aspects - but they may also ask you questions related to your past work and why you want to be a tester etc. 
- You may speak to 1-3 people. 
    - Those people might enter and leave the meeting. 
    - They may not have their cameras on and may be hard to understand. 
- Typically they don't do live coding exercises - but they might They could ask to write a sql query, setup the webdriver, right some browser interactions (findElement(By.))

## Mock Panels
This repository is focused on preparing you for upcoming interviews. This is not for learning about topics, but using as a point of reference for questions.

The SDET Questions are a collection of questions based on previous interviews with Infosys.

The Interview Prep contains a mock panel guide and a question bank covering key topics for the role:

- Java
- SQL
- Selenium
- Cucumber
- JUnit
- SDLC / STLC
- Testing Fundamentals

There is a mock panel guide that you will need to follow. At the end of each panel interviews, you will be providing feedback in a google form link that will be sent out to all of you.

## Self Study

It is essential to be comfortable with all the topics and if you are not then it is an indication that you need to do self study to catch up.

For resources on learning the topics, there is another repository focused on [Automation Testing](https://github.com/brianAray/Automation-Testing-Refresher/tree/main). Feel free to use this for your self study.
