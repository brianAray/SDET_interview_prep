# SDET Interview Prep

This repository is focused on preparing you for upcoming interviews. This is not for learning about topics, but using as a point of reference for questions.

The SDET Questions are a collection of questions based on previous interviews with Infosys.

The Interview Prep contains a mock panel guide and a question bank covering key topics for the role:

- Java
- SQL
- Selenium
- Cucumber
- SDLC / STLC
- Testing Fundamentals

It is essential to be comfortable with all the topics and if you are not then it is an indication that you need to do self study to catch up.
