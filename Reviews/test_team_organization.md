# Test Team Organization
## Testing Lifecycle
---
- **STLC**
    - STLC stands for Software Testing Life Cycle. It is a framework for managing the testing process, from planning and design to execution and reporting.
    - Phases:
        - **Requirements Analysis** 
            - Analyze the software requirements and identify the scope of testing.
        - **Test Planning**
            - Create a detailed test plan that outlines:
                - Testing approach
                - Testing objectives
                - Test scenarios
                - Test cases
                - Resource allocation
        - **Test Case Development**
            - Create detailed test cases based on the test plan and requirements.
        - **Test Environment Setup**
            - Set up the necessary hardware, software, and network environments required for testing.
        - **Test Execution** 
            - Execute the test cases and identify any defects or issues.
        - **Test Reporting**
            - Document and report any defects or issues found during testing, along with recommendations for addressing them.
        - **Test Closure** 
            - Prepare the final testing report, summarize the testing process, and provide recommendations for future testing activities.
- **Waterfall Model**
    - The Waterfall Model is a software development methodology that emphasizes a linear and sequential process. 
    - The prior phases must be completed in sequence before moving to the next phase
    - The phases of Waterfall include:
        - Requirements Gathering
        - Design
        - Development
        - Testing
        - Deployment
        - Maintenance
    - Some advantages of the Waterfall Model include:
        - Clear project objectives and deliverables
        - Well-defined roles and responsibilities
        - Predictable project timelines and costs
    - Some disadvantages of the Waterfall Model include:
        - Limited flexibility to change requirements or design
        - Difficulty accommodating changes or feedback from users
        - High risk of discovering defects late in the development process
- **V-Model**
    - The V-Model is an extension of the Waterfall Model that emphasizes verification and validation. 
    - It has a similar set of phases as the waterfall model, but with corresponding testing phases for each development phase
    - There is also a feeback loop from the testing phases back to the developement phase to ensure defects are addressed as early as possible
    - Some advantages of the V-Model include:
        - Increased focus on verification and validation
        - Better alignment of testing with development phases
        - Early detection and resolution of defects
    - Some disadvantages of the V-Model include:
        - Limited flexibility to change requirements or design
        - Difficulty accommodating changes or feedback from users
        - High risk of discovering defects late in the development process
- **Agile Model**
    - The Agile Model is an iterative and incremental approach to software development. 
    - It emphasizes collaboration, felxibility, and rapid feedback
    - It breaks down the development process into small iterations, called sprints, each with a set of goals and deliverables
    - Agile development teams work closely together, including developers, testers, and stakeholders, to ensure the software meets the needs of users
    - Some advantages of the Agile Model include:
        - Flexibility to change requirements or design as needed
        - Better alignment of development with user needs
        - Rapid feedback and continuous improvement
    - Some disadvantages of the Agile Model include:
        - Requires a high level of collaboration and communication
        - May be difficult to estimate project timelines and costs
        - May require more resources than other development methodologies
## Defect Management
---
- **Reporting Defects**
    - Reporting Defects involves documenting and communicating defects found during testing. 
    - It helps to ensure that defects are properly tracked and managed and that the necessary corrective action is taken.
- **Defect Lifecycle**
    - The Defect Lifecycle is the process of identifying, documenting, and resolving defects in software. 
        - Defect Identification
        - Defect Logging
        - Defect Analysis
        - Defect Resolution
        - Defect Verification.
